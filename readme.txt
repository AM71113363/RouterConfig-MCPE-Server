#if you dont know how portforwarding works, this "readme" its not for YOU.


build.bat will work only with Dev-C++ 4.9.9.*

//MCPE version 1.16.*
1.Start MCPE with Multiplayer [ON] (LogOut,you can use it without Xbox Login[ You can change your name ] )
2.run RouterConfig.exe (32Bit Windows) (You can Edit port number)(default = 19132)
3.Click [ Ping ].[ Ping have Timeout of 1 second,if it doesn't detect local servers click it again ]
4.Click on [Server1] , [Server2], [Server3], [Server4] to get the Details for the Router Settings.
5.Open your Router and add PortForwarding RULE.
6.Done

NOTE:
Your "friends" can join your world even if your server doesn't show >> The number of players or PingStatus.
Each time you run MCPE as Server the port will change,you have to run RouterConfig.exe to get the current Port
and change the Router Settings.

IMPORTANT:
If Ping fails enable option [ bind ].(FIREWALL WARNING)

#SETTINGS (example "12345" is the port in IntPort field)
Option 1
         ExtPort              IntPort
    Start      End       Start       End
    19132      19132     12345       12345
#With hostname:19132 others can join your world but they cant see CurrentPlayers and PingStatus.
This way you only have to update hostname if your IP changes.

Option 2
         ExtPort              IntPort
    Start      End       Start       End
    12345      12345     12345       12345
#With hostname:12345 others can join your world & they can see CurrentPlayers and PingStatus.
This way when you run MCPE as Server the port changes and you have to share it again.

Option 3
Add two port forwarding rules
        ExtPort               IntPort 
    Start      End       Start       End 
    19132      19132     19132       19132
    12345      12345     12345       12345

 #use option 3, optiom 1&2 work with previous versions,idk if it will work with latest releases.
